Proposed Shiny app contents:
1. Reproduce Figure 1 in the original article to give an overall description of the datasets. To visualize the total number of tournaments in each year, and the fraction of players having played, won and lost a certain number of matches.
2. An interactive plot of the contact network of the players in ATP tournaments. (It should look like panel A of Figure 2 in the original article.) Users can choose to restrict the visualization to certain year(s), type of court surface, or numbers of top players to display.
3. Simulation of the prestige score deriving process in the original article, and check for their match.
